# project-test-llm-d

This repository demonstrates a mature, lightweight project management workflow for the [llm-d project](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d) with monthly releases, automated processes, and Red Hat ‚Üî Open Source integration.

## üéØ Purpose
- Demonstrate GitHub Projects workflow for monthly releases
- Show Red Hat ‚Üî Open Source integration patterns
- Validate automated release processes
- Test epic-milestone organizational structure

## üìã Project Board
[View the Project Board](https://github.com/users/jeremyeder/projects/6) to see:
- **Release Pipeline**: 4-column kanban (Inbox ‚Üí This Month ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done)
- **Monthly Roadmap**: Timeline view of upcoming milestones
- **Epic Tracking**: Each milestone contains exactly one epic
- **Story Organization**: Stories reference parent epics rather than direct milestone assignment

## üîÑ Process Overview

### Epic-Milestone Structure
Each milestone contains exactly **one epic** that coordinates all release activities. Stories reference their parent epics through descriptions rather than direct milestone assignments.

## üîÑ Kubernetes-Inspired Workflow

This workflow follows battle-tested patterns from Kubernetes, adapted for faster monthly releases while maintaining the quality and community-driven approach that makes Kubernetes successful.

### Why Reference Kubernetes?
The Kubernetes project has proven that structured, time-based releases with strong community collaboration can scale to massive projects. Our workflow adapts these proven patterns for faster iteration cycles.

### Key Similarities to Kubernetes

| **Aspect** | **Kubernetes** | **llm-d** | **Benefit** |
|------------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Release Cadence** | Quarterly (4 months) | Monthly | Predictable, time-based releases |
| **Planning Process** | KEP (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal) | Epic-driven development | Upfront design and coordination |
| **Organization** | SIGs (Special Interest Groups) | SIGs + Component-based labels | Clear ownership and expertise areas |
| **Milestone Tracking** | GitHub milestones with `/milestone` | Epic-milestone 1:1 relationship | Release-focused organization |
| **Project Management** | GitHub Project Boards (2024 migration) | GitHub Project Boards | Transparent, GitHub-native workflow |
| **Release Coordination** | Dedicated Release Team with roles | Release coordination issues (building dedicated team) | Structured, role-based execution |
| **Quality Gates** | Enhancement freeze + Code freeze | Feature freeze (Week 3) | Stability through controlled changes |
| **Automation** | Custom tools, receipts process | GitHub Actions, automated scripts | Reduced manual overhead |
| **Community** | Open participation, transparency | Community labels, open planning | Inclusive, collaborative development |
| **Improvement** | Regular retrospectives, process evolution | Monthly retrospectives | Data-driven process refinement |

### What We Adapted for Faster Cycles

- **Monthly vs Quarterly**: Shorter cycles for faster feedback and delivery
- **Epics vs KEPs**: Lightweight coordination without heavy design documents
- **SIGs + Component Labels**: SIG ownership with granular component tracking
- **Release Team Evolution**: Building dedicated release team while using coordination issues
- **Automated Workflows**: More GitHub Actions integration for rapid iteration

### Familiar to Kubernetes Contributors

If you've worked with Kubernetes releases, you'll recognize:
- **Milestone-driven development** with clear release boundaries
- **Freeze periods** to ensure quality and stability
- **Release coordination** with structured checklists and responsibilities
- **GitHub Project Boards** for transparent progress tracking
- **Community-first approach** with open planning and participation

This isn't "invented here" ‚Äì it's proven patterns from one of the most successful open-source projects, optimized for monthly delivery cadence.

## ü§ñ Automation & Tools
